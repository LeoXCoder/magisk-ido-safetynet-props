Magisk module to assist in enabling safetynet on various rom's for Redmi3 (ido).  
Based primarily on ro props from https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71154562&postcount=4 

For more info see (for Mi-5): https://forum.xda-developers.com/mi-5/how-to/mi-5-passing-safetynet-unlocked-t3557845

This will also forfully enable magisk hide at boot to workaround the issue: https://github.com/topjohnwu/MagiskManager/issues/112#issuecomment-280993699
If Magisk Hide is toggled in Magisk Manager afterwards you may need to reboot to renable Magisk Hide (and safetynet)
